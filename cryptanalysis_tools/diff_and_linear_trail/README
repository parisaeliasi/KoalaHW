In this repository we provode python code for computing differential and linear trail for Koala.

Those python code use the Gurobi Solver to solve MILP model
Thise code is writen with python3 

To compute differential trail :  diff_trail_search_koala.py 

To compute linear trail : linear_trail_search_koala.py 

Both python program  compute trail for 1 to 4 round and print one with the minimal weight

To use both script:

   python3 exe.py
