In this repository we provide code to test the diffusion properies of Koala.
This code allow testing those two cipher for different state size and for different number of round.


For each cipher and each size we compute three metric: the avalanche dependency,
the avalanch weight and the avalanche entropy.

We provide a Makefile to compile the code and creat the executable diffusion
We give as argument to the executable:

 make
 ./diffusion_koala

The main is in the diffusion_exe.c file and the test are in the diffusion_test.c
